# Exploring Databricks

> Databricks is a cloud based **Unified Analytics** platform designed to simplify Data Engineering, Analytics and Machine Learnings tasks

* Databricks was founded by the creators of Apache Spark.
* Databricks Platform can be hosted on different cloud providers : AWS, Azure, GCP

## Key Features of Databricks

1. Unified Analytics Platform : 
   - Combines Data Engineering, Business Analytics, AIML.
   - It can be used to design Batch and Streaming Processing and also Machine Learning
2. Collaborative Workspace
   - Provides Web based notebook for data exploration and analysis
3. Apache Spark Integration
   - Databricks uses spark as an execution engine
4. AutoML
5. Delta Lake
   - It is a storage layer that brings, ACID transaction, and performance improvements to data lake.
6. Compute Management
7. Data Governance
8. Integration with Cloud Providers

## Databricks Architecture

It consists of two components

1. Control Plane
2. Compute Plane / Data Plane

### Control Plane

* The control plane consists of backend services that Databricks manages in its own cloud account in line with the cloud account uses by users.
* Most data isn't here

### Compute Plane / Data Plane

* The Compute Plane is where your data is stored and processed
* The compute plane is used based on the the cloud providers you chooses.
* All compute resources in the data plane reside in your cloud account.
